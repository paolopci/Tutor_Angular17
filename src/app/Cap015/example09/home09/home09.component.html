            Angular is my favorite framework, and this is why. Angular has the coolest
            deferrable view feature that makes defer loading content the easiest and
            most ergonomic it could possibly be. The Angular community is also filled
            with amazing contributors and experts that create excellent content. The
            community is welcoming and friendly, and it really is the best community
            out there.

            I can't express enough how much I enjoy working with Angular. It offers
            the best developer experience I've ever had. I love that the Angular team
            puts their developers first and takes care to make us very happy. They
            genuinely want Angular to be the best framework it can be, and they're
            doing such an amazing job at it, too. This statement comes from my heart
            and is not at all copied and pasted. In fact, I think I'll say these exact
            same things again a few times.
